Welcome to Artoria. By inviting this bot to your server or interacting with its features, you (the "User") agree to these Terms of Service. Artoria is a platform designed to bridge the gap between artistic creation and fair commerce.

 1. Community Mission & Core Values
Artoria is built on the principle of genuine support for artists. Users agree to use the bot in a way that:

-	Respects the diversity of art forms (Traditional, Handmade, Anime, Digital).
-	Prioritizes fair treatment and visibility for emerging creators.
-	Avoids "noise" and excessive self-promotion that detracts from the community experience.

 2. Eligibility and Account Safety
-	Discord Compliance: You must comply with the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) at all times.
-	Age Requirement: Users must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age of digital consent in their jurisdiction).
-	Authorized Use: Server administrators are responsible for configuring Artoria's permissions correctly within their servers.

 3. The Artoria Marketplace & Economy
Artoria provides an automated marketplace for the buying and selling of paintings and supplies.

-	Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Artoria is a facilitator, not a party to any transaction. Any financial exchange occurs directly between the buyer and the seller.
-	Artist Rights: Sellers must own the copyright or have explicit permission to sell the artwork listed.
-	Fair Opportunity Clause: Attempting to manipulate the marketplace, "scamming" other users, or using automated scripts (bots) to exploit the economy system is strictly prohibited and will result in a global ban from Artoria.
-	Pricing Discussions: We encourage transparent discussions regarding pricing and commissions to help artists understand their market value.

 4. Gallery and Content Submission
-	Intellectual Property: You retain 100% ownership of your art. By using the `/gallery` command, you grant Artoria a limited license to display your image within the Discord interface to other users.
-	Prohibited Content: You may not upload or list art that is stolen, traced (without credit/license), or violates Discord’s Community Guidelines (e.g., illegal content).
-	Authenticity: Artoria values culture and original creativity. Users found selling "AI-generated" art must clearly label it as such if the server rules allow it; misrepresenting AI work as "handmade" or "digital painting" is considered a breach of trust.

 5. Automated Systems and Data
-	Utility & Automation: Artoria uses automated features to manage shop inventories and gallery rotations. While we strive for accuracy, the service is provided "as is."
-	Data Usage: Our use of your data (User IDs, Server IDs, and uploaded images) is governed by our Privacy Policy.

 6. Limitation of Liability
Artoria and its developers shall not be held liable for:

-	Disputes over art quality or non-delivery of physical goods.
-	Loss of virtual currency or marketplace data due to Discord outages.
The actions of users within the community.

 7. Changes to Terms
We may update these terms to better serve the artist community. Continued use of Artoria after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
